## Hey, I'm Ali 😃

# Native iOS Developer 📱 

I enjoy the development because of the satisfaction I get by overcoming challenges. I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus and that’s why my Programming skills are higher than the class average at University.

When I'm not working I usually spend my time playing the computer game FIFA ⚽️.
